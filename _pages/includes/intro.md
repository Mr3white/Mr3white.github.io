I am a second-year masterâ€™s student in the School of Computer Science and Technology at [**Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)**](https://www.hust.edu.cn), under the guidance of [**Prof. Yao Wan**](http://wanyao.me). I am currently seeking a PhD position in SE/ML for Fall 2025. For an overview of my academic background, please look at my [**CV**](../assets/ZhaoyangChu_CV.pdf). If you are interested, please feel free to contact me: [chuzhaoyang@hust.edu.cn](mailto:chuzhaoyang@hust.edu.cn) \| [zychu418@gmail.com](mailto:zychu418@gmail.com).

My research interest focuses on the intersection of **software engineering** and **machine learning**, where I am particularly intrigued by:
- **Code Intelligence**, e.g., code generation, code search, and vulnerability detection.
- **Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence**, e.g., explainability, privacy, and robustness.
- **Deep Learning on Graphs**, e.g., graph neural networks (GNNs).
