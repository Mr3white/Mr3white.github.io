<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year PHD student in the College of Computer Science at [**Chongqing University (CQU)**](https://www.cqu.edu.cn), under the guidance of **Prof. Ning Wang**.

My research interest focuses on the intersection of **Privacy and Security**, where I am particularly intrigued by:
- **Pysical-layer Security**, e.g., radio frequency fingerprinting.
- **Wireless Security**, e.g., wireless sensing.
- **Intelligent Unmanned System**, e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

üåüüåü **I will be in London, UK this May to attend INFOCOM 2025, and I look forward to engaging with many of you there. I am scheduled to present my work during Session F-3 in Plaza Suite 10/11 on May 20th from 16:00 to 17:30. I warmly invite you to attend and share your valuable insights and guidance.** ü§óü§ó
